\section{}
\subsection*{a.}
The proof's error is in the inductive step, specifically, the statements "Note that $(n+1)^2 + 1 = n^2 + 1 + 2n + 1$. So adding the $(n+1)$st line creates $2n+1$ new regions". This statement assumes that $(n+1)^2 + 1$ is the number of regions after adding the $n+1$th line, without proving it. That is, the proof assumes $P(n+1)$ without proving it from $P(n)$.  

\subsection*{b.}
\textbf{Proof: } by induction on $n$. \\ 
Case $n = 1$: \\ 
For one line, the plane is divided into two sections. $(1^2 + 1 + 2)/ 2 = 4 / 2 = 2$, so $P(1)$ is true. \\ 
Inductive case: \\ 
By the inductive hypothesis, $P(n)$ is true, so $n$ lines divide the plane into $(n^2 + n + 2)/2$ regions. \\ 
As no two lines are parallel, and no three can pass through a single point, the $(n+1)$th line must intersect all the other lines. \\

\subsection*{a.}
Let $P$ be the proposition that a tree with $n$ nodes has $n - 1$ edges. \\ 
\textbf{Proof:} by induction on $n$. \\ 
Case $n = 1$: When the tree consists of a single node, there are no edges, so $m = 0 = n - 1$. Thus $P(1)$ is true. \\ 

Inductive case: \\ 
By the inductive hypothesis, $P(n)$ is true, so the number of edges in the tree of size $n$ is one less than $n$. Since the tree with $n+1$ nodes has one more node than the tree with $n$ nodes, it must necessarily also have one additional edge, that is, the one which connects $n$ to its parent. This must be the only additional edge, as if any other edge connecting the $n+1$th node to an existing node other than its parent were introduced, due to the fact that the other node is also connected to the root via its parents, a cycle would form and the binary tree would cease to be a tree. Thus the tree with $n+1$ nodes has one more edge than the tree with $n$ nodes. SInce the tree with $n$ nodes had $n-1$ edges, the tree with $n+1$ nodes has $n$ edges, and therefore $P(n+1)$ is true.

Since $P(1)$ is true and $\forall n \geq 1,\  P(n) \implies P(n+1)$, all rooted binary trees have one less edge than they do nodes.

\subsection*{b.}
\textbf{Lemma: } Any full binary tree 


\section{}
We must establish conditions under which a line separates points of different color. We will imagine that there exists a line segment between each pair of points. 
Consider all the line segments between points of the same color. Any line which separates the points by color must not intersect any of these line segments, as if it did, it would necessarily place points of the same color on opposite sides of the line. Now consider all the line segments between points of opposing colors. A line which separates the points by color must intersect each of these line segments, as otherwise it would place points of opposing color on the same side. Therefore any line which separates the points by color must
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Not intersect with any line segment between points of the same color
    \item Intersect with every line segments between points of different color
\end{enumerate}

The configurations of points can be characterized into two groups, those in which three or more points are on a line, and those in which no three points are on a line.
The configurations in which no three points are on a line can be separated into those configurations in which the four points form a convex quadrilateral, and configurations in which the four points form a concave quadrilateral. \\ 
Thus we will consider three possible cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The points are arranged such that at least three points are on one line. 
    \item The points are arranged to form a convex quadrilateral. 
    \item The points are arranged to form a concave quadrilateral.  
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Case 1:} \\ 
We will consider the three points on a line. Whether or not the fourth point is on the line is irrelevant, and we will ignore it. We will number the three points on the line 1, 2, and 3, such that they are in order as one moves along the line. Mark points 1 and 3 red, and mark point 2 blue. Now consider the line segments between the points. There exists a line segment between matching-color points 1 and 3, which passes through point 2. There also exists a line segment between different-color points 1 and 2, which is entirely contained within the line segment between 1 and 3. As stated previously, any line which separates all different-color points must intersect every line segment between different-color points, while not intersecting any line segment between same-color points. Therefore this line would need to intersect the line between 1 and 2 without intersecting the line between 1 and 3. This is not possible, as every point on the line segment between 1 and 2 is also on the line segment between 1 and 3. Therefore for any configuration in which three points are on a line, we can color them so that there exist no line which separates them by color. \\ 

\textbf{Case 2:} \\ 
If the points form a convex quadrilateral, color the points so that opposite corners of the quadrilateral have the same color. 

\textbf{Case 3:} \\ 
We can consider a concave quadrilateral instead as a triangle of three points, with another point inside of the triangle. Color the points of the triangle red, and the interior point blue. Consider the line segments between the points. The interior point is connected to each vertex of the triangle, which are entirely within the triangle. The sides of the triangle are the line segments between the red vertices. A line which separates the color must intersect the line segments between the point and the vertices without intersecting the sides of the triangle. This is impossible, because the interior line segments are entirely within the triangle, so a line intersecting them must necessarily intersect with the sides of the triangle.
