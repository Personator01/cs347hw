\subsection{}
Suppose there existed no path of width at least $\frac{F}{m}$. Since there are $m$ edges in the graph, there are at most $m$ paths from $s$ to $t$. Since each path has less than $\frac{F}{m}$ capacity, the total capacity of all paths is less than $\frac{F}{m} m = F$. Consider a cut separating $s$ from $t$. Since the maximum capacity of all paths is less than $F$, the capacity of the cut must necessarily be less than $F$, as it encompasses all paths. Since such a cut exists, any minimum cut will also have a capacity less than $F$. Therefore, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, the max flow from $s$ to $t$ is less than $F$. This is a contradiction, as $F$ cannot be less than $F$, and therefore our assumption that no path of width at least $\frac{F}{m}$ exists must be false. 

\subsection{}
As a result of $a$, the widest path must have a width of at least $\frac{F}{m}$. Pushing flow on this path once will reduce the total capacity of the residual graph by at least $\frac{F}{m}$. After $k$ applications of the process, the capacity on the residual graph will be $K - k\frac{F}{m}$, where $K$ is the initial total capacity. Therefore the residual graph will have capacity $0$ in at most as many steps as it takes for $K = k\frac{F}{m}$, or $k = \frac{m}{F}K$. As a fraction, this is $\frac{K - k\frac{F}{m}}{K}$, or $1 - \frac{k\frac{F}{m}}{K}$, or, at most $e^{\frac{Fk}{mK}}$, equivalently,
